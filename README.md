This tool allows you to pick several textures and pack their channels into a single texture.
This very useful to pack albedo with roughness, or normals with bump into the same texture for example, which helps shader optimization.

Installation
--------------

This is a regular editor plugin.
Copy the contents of `addons/zylann.channel_packer` into the same folder in your project, and activate it in your project settings.
